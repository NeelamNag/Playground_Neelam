[#PP_Security]
==== Payment Page Security

As payment information is exchanged between the merchant's system, the
consumer's browser, and _{payment-gateway}_, it is
important that the data exchange safeguards against man-in-the-middle
attacks.

The Hosted Payment Page (HPP), Embedded Payment Page (EPP), and Seamless
integration use a digital SHA-256 signature for all message exchanges.
This digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the
authenticity of a digital message or document. A valid digital signature
lets a recipient know that the message was created by a known sender,
and that it was not altered, while transmitting.

There are two types of signatures

- Request Signature
- Response Signature

//-

[#PP_Security_SecretKeyExchange]
===== Secret Key Exchange

To ensure the authenticity of the request and response messages, it is
required that a Secret Key is shared with the merchant.

The Secret Key is used in generation of the ``request_signature`` and
``response_signature`` fields.

IMPORTANT: It is important that the Secret Key is never shared with anyone and is
protected within the Merchant Website (only used in server side code for
generating the request signature or validating the response signature).

The Secret Key will be communicated at the time of Merchant Account
setup. Please contact your support representative if you did not receive
a Secret Key or require Secret Key regeneration.

[#PP_Security_DigitalSignature]
===== Digital Signature

Hosted Payment Page uses a digital SHA-256 signature for all message
exchanges. The signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the
authenticity of a digital message or document. A valid digital signature
gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a
known sender, and that it was not altered in transit.

used to sign Payment Page requests.

[#PP_Security_RequestSignature]
====== Request Signature

When the merchant creates the JavaScript data, the following values

- are to be concatenated,
- leading and trailing spaces removed, and
- SHA-256 signature follows the combined string.

//-

WARNING: Please note that the order of the fields is important. Also note, the
same values used in the request signature must be placed into the client
side data (with the exception of the secret key).

. ``request_time_stamp``
. ``request_id``
. ``merchant_account_id``
. ``transaction_type``
. ``requested_amount``
. ``requested_amount_currency``
. ``redirect_url`` (optional)
. ``custom_css_url`` (optional)
. ``ip_address`` (optional)
. ``[secretkey]``

//-

NOTE: If an optional field is used in the request data, it is mandatory in the
request signature.

The SHA-256 hash value is then presented on the merchants client side
form as ``request_signature`` field.

An example of request signature generation is as follows:


----

[#PP_Security_ResponseSignature]
====== Response Signature

Within the response message the following values

- are concatenated,
- leading and trailing space removed, and
- SHA-256 signature follows the combined string.

//-

Response signature calculation is very similar to request signature
calculation. String of the concatenated fields is hashed with SHA256 so
the algorithm is very same as already explained above. There are just
different fields in different order concatenated. Use the following
fields in this exact order only when creating the "string to hash":

. ``merchant_account_id``
. ``transaction_id``
. ``request_id``
. ``transaction_type``
. ``transaction_state``
. ``completion_time_stamp``
. ``token_id``
. ``masked_account_number``
. ``ip_address``
. ``authorization_code``
. ``[secretkey]``

//-

If the particular field is missing in response then the empty string
should be used instead of this field.

[#PP_Security_SignatureGenerationCodeSamples]
====== Signature Generation Code Samples

Below you find code samples in various programming languages that you
can use in your shop system. These samples take care of generating
digital request signature.

.PHP Example (PHP 5 >= 5.1.2, PHP 7, PECL hash >= 1.1)
[source,php]
----
$request_signature = hash('sha256', trim($request_time_stamp . $request_id . $merchant_account_id . $transaction_type . $requested_amount . $request_amount_currency . $redirect_url . $ip_address . $secret_key));
----

.C# / ASP.NET Example
[source,csharp]
----

.Java Example
[source,java]
----
private static String tosha256(String... fields) {
    StringBuffer sb = null;
    try {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        sb = new StringBuffer();
        for (String field : fields) {
            sb.append(field.trim());
        }
        md.update(sb.toString().getBytes("utf-8"));
        byte[] mdbytes = md.digest();
        return DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(mdbytes);
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        sb = null;
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        sb = null;
    }
    return sb == null ? null : sb.toString();
}

.GROOVY Example
[source,java]
----
import java.security.MessageDigest;
...

def messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA256");
def secret_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';

def stringToHash = time_stamp + request_id + merchant_account_id + transaction_type + requested_amount + requested_amount_currency + redirect_url + ip_address + secret_key;

messageDigest.update( stringToHash.trim().getBytes() );
def shaHex = new BigInteger(1, messageDigest.digest()).toString(16);
